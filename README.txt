HTML programming isn't hard. The hardest thing for us to overcome is working together as a team.
So we're going to create some baselines.

1. The final product of the website (The part that acts as the mainpage, for example) should be named index.html
2. Comment often and whenever.
3. Do not overly shorthand code (don't turn index into idx, for example).

HOW TO USE GITHUB (Because I really don't know how)
1. Download GitHub onto your computer (https://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe)
2. Copy the repository onto your GitHub by clicking on the + -> Clone -> CSCWebsite (http://i.imgur.com/ynxMsGC.gif)
3. Access the code, and anything inside the repository, by clicking on Options -> Open in Explorer (http://i.imgur.com/c2TToX7.gif)
4. Have fun!
